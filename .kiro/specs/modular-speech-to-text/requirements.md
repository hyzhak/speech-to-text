# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a modular speech-to-text architecture that can utilize different ML models (starting with Whisper) to convert audio files to text. The system is designed with modularity in mind, allowing components to be easily replaced for testing or different implementations. The initial version focuses on batch processing with CLI interface, while maintaining architecture that can support streaming in future iterations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to process audio files through a CLI interface, so that I can convert speech to text in batch mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the CLI command with an audio file path THEN the system SHALL process the file and output text to stdout
2. WHEN a user provides an output file path parameter THEN the system SHALL save the transcribed text to the specified file
3. WHEN a user provides an invalid audio file path THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the CLI is called without required parameters THEN the system SHALL display usage instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a modular architecture for ML models, so that I can easily swap between different speech-to-text implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load ML models through a standardized interface
2. WHEN a mock ML model is configured THEN the system SHALL use it instead of the real model for testing
3. WHEN switching between different ML model implementations THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API contract
4. IF a model fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and fallback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want containerized services with proper orchestration, so that I can deploy and manage the system reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN each service SHALL run in its own Docker container with isolated root directory
2. WHEN running docker-compose THEN all services SHALL start and communicate properly
3. WHEN running tests THEN separate docker-compose configurations SHALL be available for unit and integration tests
4. WHEN scaling services THEN containers SHALL be independently scalable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can ensure system reliability and facilitate development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN they SHALL execute in isolated containers with mock dependencies
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL test real component interactions in containerized environment
3. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL provide clear pass/fail status and coverage information
4. WHEN using test doubles THEN mock implementations SHALL be easily configurable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want observability through OpenTelemetry, so that I can monitor system performance without vendor lock-in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes requests THEN it SHALL emit structured logs via OpenTelemetry
2. WHEN configuring observability THEN the system SHALL support different backends through collector configuration
3. WHEN switching observability vendors THEN the application code SHALL remain unchanged
4. IF LGTM stack is configured THEN logs SHALL be properly forwarded and formatted

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated workflow management, so that I can streamline development and deployment processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing complex operations THEN bash scripts SHALL combine multiple commands appropriately
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use uv for Python package management
3. WHEN building the system THEN all components SHALL integrate seamlessly through orchestration scripts
4. WHEN deploying THEN automated scripts SHALL handle environment setup and service coordination

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want proper development workflow integration, so that I can maintain code quality and track progress effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making commits THEN they SHALL follow conventional commit format (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
2. WHEN creating tasks THEN they SHALL be reflected as GitHub issues in the hyzhak/speech-to-text repository
3. WHEN implementing features THEN progress and challenges SHALL be documented in issue comments
4. WHEN completing tasks THEN git flow style branches SHALL be created and PRs submitted for review

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer committed to open source principles, I want the system to use only free and open source software with open ML models, so that the solution remains accessible and transparent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting ML models THEN the system SHALL only use open source models (like Whisper)
2. WHEN choosing dependencies THEN all software components SHALL be free and open source
3. WHEN deploying the system THEN no proprietary licenses SHALL be required
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN new components SHALL maintain open source compatibility

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear documentation, so that I can quickly understand and use the system without prior knowledge of the tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the README THEN it SHALL provide step-by-step setup and usage instructions
2. WHEN following documentation THEN users SHALL be able to run the system without additional tool knowledge
3. WHEN features are implemented THEN documentation SHALL be updated to reflect current capabilities
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN common issues and solutions SHALL be documented
