# Implementation Plan

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: GitHub Workflow Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: Every task implementation MUST follow the complete GitHub workflow defined in `.kiro/steering/workflow.md`. This is not optional.

### Required Workflow Steps for Each Task:

1. **Create GitHub Issue** - Create detailed issue with acceptance criteria
2. **Prepare Local Environment** - Ensure clean main branch and pull latest changes  
3. **Create Feature Branch** - Use `feature/issue-number-brief-description` naming
4. **Implementation and Testing** - Implement functionality with comprehensive tests
5. **Document Progress** - Add detailed comments to GitHub issue throughout implementation
6. **Commit Changes** - Use conventional commit format with issue references
7. **Push Branch** - Push feature branch to GitHub
8. **Create Pull Request** - Create PR with detailed description referencing issue
9. **Request Copilot Review** - Trigger automated Copilot review if available
10. **Wait for Validation** - Ensure all CI/CD checks pass
11. **Evaluate and Respond to Feedback** - Critically assess each comment (Accept ‚úÖ/Consider ü§î/Reject ‚ùå)
12. **Implement Accepted Changes** - Only implement beneficial feedback
13. **Repeat Review Process** - Continue until all feedback is addressed
14. **Merge When Ready** - Squash and merge when approved
15. **Clean Up Local Environment** - Switch to main, pull changes, delete feature branch
16. **Complete Task** - Verify issue closure and add final comments

### Code Quality Requirements:
- **Linting**: Run `./scripts/lint.sh` after every Python code change
- **Testing**: Ensure 100% test pass rate using `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build test-shared --abort-on-container-exit`
- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- **Error Handling**: Use proper exception handling with custom exception classes

### Commit Message Format:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <emoji> <description> (#issue-number)

[optional body]
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore  
**Examples**: 
- `feat: üèóÔ∏è implement shared data models and interfaces (#6)`
- `fix: üêõ resolve Docker RUN command syntax error (#7)`
